# Auto Login
An ad-hoc solution to automatically logging into the IIT(BHU) wifi network.
(For personal use though, do whatever you want with this)


## Current features
- Autofill credentials and click submit when the login page url is opened.


## TODO
- Close the login tab after successful login, and display a success message.
- Detech when the session expires and re-login automatically.
